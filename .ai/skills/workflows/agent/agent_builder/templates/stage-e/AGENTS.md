# Agent Builder Stage E Templates

## Purpose
Templates used by the `agent-builder` verification step to produce reproducible evidence artifacts.

## Files
- `verification-evidence.schema.json`: JSON schema for machine-readable evidence
- `verification-evidence.example.json`: example evidence payload
- `verification-report.template.md`: Markdown template for the human-readable report

## Usage
Generated by the Stage E verify command and copied into the agent's `docs/` output for retention.

## Rules (MUST)
- Evidence MUST be reproducible and sanitized (no secrets).
- If you change the evidence JSON shape, update both the schema and the report template.
